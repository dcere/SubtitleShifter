1
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:33,534
Forget it. It's too risky.
I'm through doing that shit.

2
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,070
You always say that.
The same thing every time.

3
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:39,072
"I'm through, never again,
too dangerous."

4
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:41,642
I know that's what I always say.
I'm always right too.

5
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:45,112
- You forget about it in a day or two.
- The days of me forgetting are over.

6
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:47,281
The days of me remembering
have just begun.

7
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:49,516
You know, when you go on like this,
what you sound like?

8
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:52,619
- I sound like a sensible fuckin' man.
- You sound like a duck.

9
00:00:52,686 --> 00:00:56,156
- Quack, quack, quack.
- Take heart, 'cause you're never
gonna have to hear it again.

10
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:59,726
Since I'm never gonna
do it again, you're never
gonna have to hear me quack.

11
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:04,531
- After tonight?
- Correct. I got all tonight to quack.

12
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:07,434
- Can I get anyone more coffee?
- Oh, yes!

13
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:11,805
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

14
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:14,975
I mean, the way it is now,

15
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:17,845
you're takin' the same risk
as when you rob a bank.

16
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,980
Takin' more of a risk.
Banks are easier.

17
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:23,083
Federal banks ain't supposed to stop you
in any way during a robbery.

18
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:27,387
They're insured. Why should
they give a fuck? I don't even
need a gun in a Federal bank.

19
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:30,924
Heard about this one bloke, he walks
into a bank with a portable phone.

20
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:33,961
He gives the phone to a teller.
The bloke on the other end says,

21
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:37,598
"We got this guy's little girl.
If you don't give him all your
money, we're gonna kill her."

22
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:40,467
- Did it work?
- Fuckin' right it worked.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

23
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:46,373
Knucklehead walks into a bank
with a telephone. Not a pistol,
not a shotgun, a fuckin' phone.

24
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:51,078
- Cleans the place out.
They don't lift a fuckin' finger.
- Did they hurt the little girl?

25
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:54,848
There probably never was
a little girl. The point of
the story isn't a little girl.

26
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:57,918
The point of the story is they
robbed a bank with a telephone.

27
00:01:57,985 --> 00:02:00,954
- You want to rob banks?
- I'm not saying I wanna rob banks.

28
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:03,457
I'm illustrating if we did, it'd be
easier than what we've been doing.

29
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:07,694
-No more liquor stores?
-What've we been talkin' about?
Yeah, no more liquor stores.

30
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:10,731
Besides, it ain't the giggle
it used to be. There's too many
foreigners own liquor stores.

31
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,733
Vietnamese, Koreans,
don't even speak fuckin' English.

32
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,169
You tell'em empty out
the register, they don't know
what you're talkin' about.

33
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:17,171
They make it too personal.

34
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:21,475
- We keep on, one of these gook
fuckers gonna make us kill him.
- I'm not gonna kill anybody.

35
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:25,846
I don't want to either.
But they'll probably put us
in a situation where it's us or them.

36
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:27,848
And if it's not the gooks,

37
00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:30,551
it's these old fuckin' Jews who've owned
the store for 15 fucking generations.

38
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:35,055
You got Grandpa Irving sitting
behind the counter with
a fucking Magnum in his hand.

39
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:37,057
Try walkin' into one of those places
with nothing but a phone.

40
00:02:37,124 --> 00:02:39,059
See how far that gets you.
Forget it.

41
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:42,062
- We're out of it.
- Well, what then, day jobs?

42
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:44,164
- Not in this life.
- What then?

43
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,535
Garçon, coffee!

44
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:50,904
This place.

45
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:55,475
Garçon means boy.

46
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:01,381
This place?
A coffee shop?

47
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:04,418
What's wrong with that?

48
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:08,155
Nobody ever robs restaurants.
Why not?

49
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:11,558
Bars, liquor stores,

50
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:15,362
gas stations; you get your head
blown off stickin' up one of them.

51
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:19,099
Restaurants, on the other hand,
you catch with their pants down.

52
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:22,870
They're not expectin' to get robbed.
Not as expectin' anyway.

53
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:27,441
- I bet you could cut down on the
hero factor in a place like this.
- Correct.

54
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:30,777
Same as banks,
these places are insured.

55
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:33,213
Manager.
He don't give a fuck.

56
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,116
They're just trying to get you out
before you start pluggin' the diners.

57
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:40,153
Waitresses. Fuckin' forget it.
No way they're takin' a bullet
for the register.

58
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,156
Busboys. Some wetback gettin'
paid $1.50 an hour...

59
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,759
really give a fuck
you're stealin' from the owner?

60
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:48,929
Customers sittin' there
with food in their mouths,
they don't know what's goin' on.

61
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:53,667
One minute, they're havin'
a Denver omelet, the next, someone
is stickin' a gun in their face.

62
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:58,805
See, I got the idea the last
liquor store we stuck up, remember?

63
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:01,575
- All the customers kept comin' in.
- Yeah.

64
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:05,479
You got the idea
of takin' their wallets.
Now, that was a good idea.

65
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:08,949
- Thank you.
- Made more from the wallets
than we did from the register.

66
00:04:09,016 --> 00:04:11,318
- Yes, we did.
- A lot of people come to restaurants.

67
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:15,055
- A lot of wallets.
- Pretty smart, huh?

68
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:17,157
Pretty smart.

69
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:21,728
I'm ready. Let's do it.
Right now, right here.

70
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:26,300
- Come on.
- All right. Same as
last time, remember?

71
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:29,136
You're crowd control.
I'll handle the employees.

72
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:37,477
- I love you, Pumpkin.
- I love you, Honey Bunny.

73
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:41,181
Everybody be cool!
This is a robbery!

74
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,151
Any of you fucking pricks move,

75
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:48,121
and I'll execute
every motherfuckin' last one of you.

76
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:48,422
and I'll execute
every motherfuckin' last one of you.
